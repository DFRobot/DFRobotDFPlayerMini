//new example for hardware serial
//hardware serial is useful for those using nodemcu / esp8266 and have minimal gpio pins available.
//simply connect nodemcu / esp tx to Rx of dfplayer, power, gnd, speakers, that's it! 
//use below in setup and everything else remains as is in full function example
//if you need to update sketch, pull out tx -> rx wire. I've tried with http web update and it does not need any wires to be changed.

#include "DFRobotDFPlayerMini.h"

DFRobotDFPlayerMini myDFPlayer;

void setup(void){

myDFPlayer.begin(Serial); //Use hardware Serial to communicate with mp3 player.
  delay(1);  //wait 1ms for mp3 module to set volume
  myDFPlayer.volume(20);  // mp3_set_volume (20);
  delay(2);

  Serial.begin(9600);
    delay(10);
    
  Serial.println();
  Serial.println("ESP starting .....");
  
  // beyond this, all regular code according to your sketch or full function example...
